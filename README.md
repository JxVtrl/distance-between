Contest:
Thank you for applying for this opportunity! 
Here is the test to be developed!
Build a web app that calculates the distance between two airports in nautical miles, using auto-complete for the airport fields. Airports should be searchable by name or 3 digit code. 
Bonus: plot the route on Google maps. 
You will be evaluated based on:
1. The structure of your React components, HTML and CSS structure
2. Use of Material UI components
3. The cleanliness (or whatever else you care about) of your visual design
4. Appropriate use of TypeScript
5. Being mobile friendly
Note: Create a Github private repository and give access to @adrianobnu
We have 3 opportunities open on this stack. The sooner we receive your test, the greater the chance of being hired.
